// 5.  Finally, the struggle begins: Loop over the list of kings, either hailing
//     or declaiming them as above (depending if they are on the Iron Throne);
//     at the end of each loop, remove one king at random and print the line
//     from #4 (that they must *kneel*), and then loop over the list again. Do
//     this until there is only one king left. If at any time the king on the
//     Iron Throne is removed, ensure that the next in line (the first king in
//     the list) is now placed upon it (their ironThrone property is set to
//     true).
