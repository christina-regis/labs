First build two objects mom and dad as object literals (e.g. var mom = {};). If you have a non-traditional family structure, just use someone everybody loves, like Joe Biden or Oprah.
Create one Personality object for each parent (e.g. mom.personality = {};);
Using the different data types (Number, String, Array, Object, Null, & Boolean) add 5 physical attributes your parents.
Do the same with the personality objects!
Now bulid yourself by referencing physical and personality attributes from your folks!
Make 2 lists: first, what you're good at, and second, what you're bad at.
Age yourself.
Delete half of the things you were good at
Age yourself.
Add 'sitting' to the things you're good at and remove everything else from the list.
Add 5 more things to the list of things you're bad at.
Delete yourself from the window
