# Birds of LA

![:image](http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2BXpb4cgqL._SL500_SX258_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg)

You've just started your second project at the dev agency professionalnobodies.biz

You've been embedded in a hot new bird watching start up.

The previous developer left in a hurry to work on the Bernie Sanders campaign
leaving you as the lead developer on a new birdfinder app.

"She said she was just about to implement mongo and mongoose" says the 53-year-old office
intern, reading off a Post-It note.

She hands you the crumpled note with the following tasks

- [x] Resignation Letter
- [ ] Implement mongo and mongoose
- [ ] expose an API. when a user visits `/api/sightings` render all the sightings as JSON
- [ ] when a user posts to `/api/sightings/` add a new sighting

# Sparrow me

"People make mistakes!" you hear the receptionist sobbing. This
gets you thinking "maybe if we didn't already, we should implement promises with mongoose"

- [ ] use then and catch to handle creating sightings
- [ ] use then and catch to handle getting sightings

# Where do we flamingo from here?

The next day you run into your project manager by the photocopier. "Nice work, but
I want to include the location and when it was sighted. I think it'll really set us apart in the bird watching biz," she says, printing
out her resume.

You scribble down onto a Post-It note

- [ ] Store date information
- [ ] Add address information

# Cockatoo where are you?

As you pass the UX designer hunched over the fax machine she asks if you know the
zipcode for Vermont.  "If only it was as easy to look up as it is to geocode addresses
with the [NPM package geocoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/geocoder)." she chuckles.

You jot down the following onto a Post-It note

- [ ] geocode locations and store their lat/long?
- [ ] figure out UX designer's name

# Toucan do it!

The CEO calls you into her office, mutes the TED Talk she's watching and says "You know,
since getting out of Rikers I've heard a ton about this AJAX thing. I want you to
put together a demo page that I can show to our shareholders. I'll tell them to
go to /demo and click on a link and see all our bird data. And then I want them
to type in an address and send back the lat/long all with AJAX."

- [ ] create '/demo' page
- [ ] ajax the bird data and render it
- [ ] ajax a location and geocode it

# Goose your own way

At your project manager's going away party you make small talk with the still
unnamed UX designer.  "Have you read this blog post on GeoSpatial queries? What if
we could show bird sightings by proximity to the user?? Gimme that Post-It!"

She scribbles down the following

- [ ] http://blog.robertonodi.me/how-to-use-geospatial-indexing-in-mongodb-using-express-and-mongoose/
- [ ] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation/Using_geolocation
- [ ] Get a user's location and query db for locations
- [ ] Make more eye contact
